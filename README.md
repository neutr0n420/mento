# Mento - Pay for the time you teach.

Mento is a decentralized platform that connects mentors (teachers) with students, enabling mentors to get paid for the time they teach. The platform provides a flexible and transparent way for educators to monetize their skills while students can easily find and book sessions with mentors who match their learning needs.

## Features

1. Create Gigs: Mentors can create teaching sessions (gigs) by providing details such as title, description, time, and payment rate.
2. Purchase Gigs: Students can book a gig by paying an advance fee, securing a spot in the session.
3. Earn as You Teach: Mentors receive payments based on the time they spend teaching, with payment rates set per session.
4. Tokenized Access: Each gig is represented as an NFT, giving students tokenized proof of their booking. This allows mentors to track attendance and provides students with digital access tokens.
5. Student Dashboard: Students can view and manage their booked classes.
6. Mentor Dashboard: Mentors can track their active gigs, including the number of attendees and payments received.

## Smart Contracts Overview

1. The smart contract for Mento uses the ERC-1155 token standard to manage tokenized access for gigs. Key functionalities include:
2. Gig Creation: Mentors can create new gigs, which mint a new token representing the session.
3. Gig Purchase: Students can buy gigs by paying a fee, securing a token that grants them access.
4. Tracking Gigs and Attendees: The contract tracks all active gigs and their attendees.
